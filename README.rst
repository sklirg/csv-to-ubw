CSV to UBW
----------

A browser extension which adds support for dropping a CSV file
into a UBW time sheet to fill in the time sheet from the CSV data.

It works out of the box when downloading detailed reports from Toggl dashboard. This should also work for any CSV formatted the same way as Toggl detailed reports.
